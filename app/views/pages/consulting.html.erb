          <p class="services_p2 reveal">
          <strong>BASIC RESEARCH:</strong> Which products are best to sell, which prices are the best, delivery time acceptable to customers, rebate policy, who are potential customers, how to attract and convert visitors to customers.
          <br><br><strong>INDUSTRY RESEARCH:</strong> Sales and advertising of the entire industry, organic and paid search, SEO keywords, rebates, coupons, and customers.
          <br><br><strong>COMPETITION RESEARCH:</strong> Who is primary and who is secondary competition, how they sell, rebate policy, delivery terms, customer support, UX&UI of their web stores, advantages and disadvantages, budgets they use for advertising, how they advertise, how their ads look, how to win the battle for customers.
          <br><br>We are creating a strategy and timeline for your web store based on research
          <br><br>Maintaining a web shop is essential for lasting health and success. Maintenance service should include WP updates, theme and plugin updates, WP backups and security, analytics monitoring and reporting.
          <br><br>There are two options: independent maintenance and through a MITA.agency, but also a combination (e.g. client training for part of the backend, product input).
          <br><br>We recommend a self-maintenance to all clients for online stores because products have to be constantly added, quantities and other content updated. In this case, we will train you to use the content (product) management system (CMS) in person or remotely using ZOOM, Microsoft Teams and other screen-sharing applications.
          <br><br>The agency is also available for regular technical maintenance of the eCommerce website and SEO optimisation for a monthly fee.
