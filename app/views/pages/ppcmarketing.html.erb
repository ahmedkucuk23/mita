          <p class="services_p2 reveal">
            From paid search and display advertising to paid social campaigns, PAID ADVERTISING is crucial for brand awareness, Google position and affordable sales conversions on your web store. We know that paid media game is highly competitive, but it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the best in the saturated market. Our paid media experts will work to develop a strategy and approach that will help you achieve sales goals with less advertising money spent.
            <br><br><strong>SETTING THE RIGHT GOALS</strong> with realistic and achievable KPIs (key performance indicators) is essential to the paid media strategy. Without goals and KPIs in place, advertisers don’t have any markers to see – where they start and where to go. We will set the right KPIs to help you reach new sales conversion heights. Based on that, we will choose which paid media platforms are best for you, which types of ads are best for you, and which lead management strategy you need. We’ll get you straight to where you need to go based on calculated measures that help us know what will do the job—and what won’t.
            <br><br><strong>SETTING YOUR BAYER PERSONA</strong> will identify who they are, where they spend their time most, and the best options for targeting them effectively.
            <br><br><strong>SETTING CUSTOMER YOURNEY</strong> is a roadmap detailing how a customer becomes aware of your brand, and the interactions they will have with your brand on their journey to become a customer—and beyond. This involves several stages: awareness, consideration, and decision divided into BOFU (bottom of the sales funnel) MOFU (middle of the sales funnel) and TOFU (top of the sales funnel) strategies. You will need all three if you want to show your customers that you understand them.
            <br><br><strong>DAILY ADS MONITORING</strong> is crucial for PPC optimisation. Our PPC experts don’t just set it and forget it. We monitor and optimize ads daily to ensure your advertising money is getting you results.
          </p>
          <p class="services_p2 reveal">
            <strong>CREATING DIFFERENT ADS</strong> for customers at each stage of their journey is one of the things we do best.
          </p>
          <ul class="services_p2 reveal">
            <li>During the first stage, we use clickable and brand awareness ads to navigate through the traditional media, networks of premium inventory and premium position web portals, social media (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube), communication platforms (WhatsApp, Messenger, Viber), and search engines (Google) to reach the target group quickly, build brand awareness, collect data, and increase high quality targeted website/webshop traffic. </li>
            <li>During the second and third advertising stages, we focus on repeating exposure to increase engagement, generate sales leads databases and close sales at the lowest conversion costs. We use more appealing and converting ads for both phases based on consumer behaviour.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3 class="services_p2 reveal"><strong>WE KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE:</strong></h3>
          <ul class="services_p2 reveal">
            <li>What the optimal campaign period is; after that, the number of leads drops, and acquisition cost rises;</li>
            <li>The percentage of all visits and leads coming from mobile phones</li>
            <li>The part of ad customers do not like when potential customers stop viewing video ads and how to improve video ad conversion</li>
            <li>The difference in conversation rates of video ads and simple animations</li>
            <li>The percentage of leads generated within the first five days of the campaign and the percentage of leads generated after that</li>
            <li>The most effective web banners and the second best ones</li>
