          <ul class="services_p2 reveal">
            <li>Creating and <strong>loading static content</strong></li>
            <li>Creating <strong>categories and taxonomies</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Product entry and product options,</strong> technical specifications</li>

          DSP environment and coding according to the highest standards are crucial to avoid major problems. During the creation of the web store, we use three different types of servers:
          </strong></h3>
          <p class="services_p2 reveal"><strong>The DEVELOPMENT SERVER</strong> is for the first version of the web store and before the launch: coding, installation of the necessary plugins, and customization of the theme. After the website gets its outlines and is filled with the demo content, we are going to the next level.
          <br><br><strong>The STAGING SERVER</strong> is a locked environment for the administrator and team working on the web store. All future changes, even after the launch, will be done on a staging server, and testing (QA) before being published on the production server.
          <br><br><strong>The PRODUCTION SERVER</strong> is the live website publicly available to all users. It is crucial to host the web store on reliable and fast cloud systems with optimized costs so you do not pay more than you need.</p>
          <h3 class="services_p2 reveal"><strong>Before launching your online store we will:</strong></h3>
          <ul class="services_p2 reveal">
            <li><strong>Check twice security</strong> - Personal data are crucial, so we often use free CDN-type products that protect against threats like SQL injection attacks and identity theft. We take care of website performance and speed up load times using its multiple data centres worldwide.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide QA testing </strong> - The site is ready for testing when all its visual elements and content (products, prices, categories, blogs, texts) are loaded. We ensure proper QA testing to confirm that all web page links work and that the page can load correctly on all browsers and devices. After launch, testing and optimisation do not end. We use specialised tools to investigate how visitors use the web store, what parts they click on and what we need to change.</li>
            <li><strong>Fix and clean all bugs</strong>- Test functionalities and review the page meta titles and descriptions. Even how the words are arranged in the meta title can affect a page's performance on search engines. We must check all payment methods and make test purchases.</li>
